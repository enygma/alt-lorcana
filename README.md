# Alt Lorcana

Many other game formats for Lorcana have come up since the game's release. This document describes each of them and the rules.

# Alternative Gameplay Options

## Sealed
In this type of limited format, instead of playing with a prebuilt deck, players are given six booster packs each. The players can then open these decks, looking at all of the cards, and create a 40 card deck using only them.

Play then conmences according to the usual Lorcana rules.

## Draft
In this limited format, players are given four booster packs each. They all open their first packs and select a card from its contents. The pack is then passed to the player to their left, select a card, pass the pack to the left...and so on until all cards are exhausted. This pattern continues for all four of the booster packs provided to each person.

Players should end up with 48 cards. Each player should then remove 8 cards to make a 40 card deck.

Play then continues according to the normal Lorcana rules.

## 2 versus 2
In this format, teams of 2 are playing against each other. Just like in regular Lorcana rules, the team that goes first does not draw. When it is each team's turn both players on that team play at the same time. Players can take actions on any of the opposing team's cards in play. 

1. Teammates cannot pay the ink cost or ink cards from their teammate's hand.
2. Teammates may view and discuss each others' hands
3. Effects that read "each opponent" or "each player" affect each team member separately

As in normal Lorcana play, the goal is to get to 20 lore. However, both players on the team must reach 20 EACH, not combined.
This format can also be played in a 3 versus 3 mode if multiplayer is not desired.

## Pack Rush
The pack rush format is great for casual games and plays quickly due to the limited numbers of cards. To play pack rush, each player uses two booster packs. Open them, remove the extra cards. Shuffle the cards without looking at them.

1. The addiitonal cards, whatever they are for the given set (puzzle cards, rules cards, Gateway promos, etc.) become the first two ink for each player. These are played before the opening hand into your inkwell.
2. Players are not allowed to look at their decks.
3. Players draw five cards for starting hand.
4. ALL cards are inkable.
5. If a player's draw pile is exhausted, they should shuffle their discard and that becomes their new draw deck.

Play then continues according to the usual Lorcana rules (with the exceptions listed above) with the goal of getting to 15 lore.
